# Depth Blur Project

## Video

Video TKTK

## Summary

Turn in four (4) images in the JPEG file format and a link to a Lightroom album with one hundred (100) images taken for this project.

- You can photograph anything you want.
- One (1) image should demonstrate **fozen motion**.
- One (1) image should demonstrate **blurred motion**.
- One (1) image should demonstrate **large depth of field**.
- One (1) image should demonstrate **shallow depth of field**.
- We will look at the images you submit in this week's discussion for online students and in class for in-person students.

## Suggestions

- You are allowed to turn in images you took for the depth of field and shutter speed assignments.
- Your grade will be better if you turn in brand new work.
- For the large depth of field and frozen motion images, you need a lot of light.
- For the shallow depth of field and blurred motion images, you need low light.
- Don't delete images as you go. It's ok if some of the 100 images are not great.
- When you adjust the aperture or shutter speed, you have to adjust the other control to compensate.
- Your light meter should still indicate a proper exposure before you take the image.
- Look at the examples provided next to this page in D2L/Brightspace.

## Turn In...

- Submit four (4) of your best images that meet the requirements in the "Summary" section above.
- Use “Full Size” for Adobe Online or “JPEG Large” for the Lightroom App when you download the images.
- Create a Lightroom album with all project images. Ensure all album settings are turned on and set “Link Access” to “Anyone Can View.”
- Paste the album link into the comments section of the D2L Assignment Dropbox and submit your four JPEG images there.
- Check the FAQs section in D2L/Brightspace for instructions on turning in work.

## Requirements for grading.

To be graded, images must:

- Be taken this semester for this class.
- Contain EXIF metadata from the camera.
- Be submitted using D2L Assignment Dropbox.
- Contain a link to a shared album pasted into comments.
- Contain a link to a shared album that can be viewed.

## Additional Requirements.

Images should also:

- Be taken in manual exposure mode.
- Taken in camera raw.
- Be properly exposed
- Be imported, organized, shared, and exported using Lightroom.
- Include the specified number of images in the JPEG format.
- Include enough images in linked album.

## Learning Outcomes

- Make photographs using DSLR cameras in the RAW file type.
- Correctly expose images using a light meter.
- Create images using shutter speed to freeze motion and blur motion.
- Create images using aperture, focal length, and distance from the subject, to make images with large depth of field and shallow depth of field.
- Import, organize, rename, and export images in Lightroom.
- Compose images using techniques discussed in class.
